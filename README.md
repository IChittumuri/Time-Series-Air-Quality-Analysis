### Abstract
Beijing, China is known to experience one of the worst air pollution worldwide. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collaborates with Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) to offer guidance on ambient air quality standards for six principal pollutants that can be harmful to public and environmental health [1]. In this project, we studied the statistical time series analysis of PM2.5 concentration levels in Beijing to model, forecast, and determine air quality levels.
